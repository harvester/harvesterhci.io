:::warning

**CVE-2025-1974** (vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) has a score of [9.8 (Critical)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3-1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

The vulnerability affects specific versions of the RKE2 ingress-nginx controller (v.1.11.4 and earlier, and v1.12.0). All Harvester versions that use this controller (including v1.4.2 and later) are therefore affected.

:::

A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where under certain conditions, an unauthenticated attacker with access to the pod network can achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller. This can lead to disclosure of secrets accessible to the controller. (Note that in the default installation, the controller can access all secrets cluster-wide.)

You can confirm the version of the RKE2 ingress-nginx pods by running this command on your Harvester cluster:

```sh
kubectl -n kube-system get po -l"app.kubernetes.io/name=rke2-ingress-nginx" -ojsonpath='{.items[].spec.containers[].image}'
```

If the command returns one of the affected versions, disable the `rke2-ingress-nginx-admission` validating webhook configuration by performing the following steps:

1. On one of your control plane nodes, use `kubectl` to confirm the existence of the `HelmChartConfig` resource named `rke2-ingress-nginx`:

   ```sh
   $ kubectl -n kube-system get helmchartconfig rke2-ingress-nginx
   NAME                 AGE
   rke2-ingress-nginx   14d1h
   ```

1. Use `kubectl -n kube-system edit helmchartconfig rke2-ingress-nginx` to add the following configurations to the resource:

    * `.spec.valuesContent.controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled: false`
    * `.spec.valuesContent.controller.extraArgs.enable-annotation-validation: true`

1. The following is an example of what the updated `.spec.valuesContent` configuration along with the default Harvester ingress-nginx configuration should look like:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1
  kind: HelmChartConfig
  metadata:
    name: rke2-ingress-nginx
    namespace: kube-system
  spec:
    valuesContent: |-
      controller:
        admissionWebhooks:
          port: 8444
          enabled: false
        extraArgs:
          enable-annotation-validation: true
          default-ssl-certificate: cattle-system/tls-rancher-internal
        config:
          proxy-body-size: "0"
          proxy-request-buffering: "off"
        publishService:
          pathOverride: kube-system/ingress-expose
  ```

   Exit the `kubectl edit` command execution to save the configuration. 

   Harvester automatically applies the change once the content is saved.

 :::info important

   The configuration disables the RKE2 ingress-nginx admission webhooks while preserving Harvester's default ingress-nginx configuration.

   If the `HelmChartConfig` resource contains other custom ingress-nginx configuration, you must retain them when editing the resource.

 :::

1. Verify that RKE2 deleted the `rke2-ingress-nginx-admission` validating webhook configuration.

   ```sh
   $ kubectl get validatingwebhookconfiguration rke2-ingress-nginx-admission
   Error from server (NotFound): validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io "rke2-ingress-nginx-admission" not found
   ```

1. Verify that the ingress-nginx pods are restarted successfully.

   ```sh
   $ kubectl -n kube-system get po -lapp.kubernetes.io/instance=rke2-ingress-nginx
   NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   rke2-ingress-nginx-controller-g8l49   1/1     Running   0          5s
   ```

Once your Harvester cluster receives the RKE2 ingress-nginx patch, you can re-install the `rke2-ingress-nginx-admission` validating webhook configuration by removing the `HelmChartConfig` patch.

:::info important
These steps only cover the RKE2 ingress-nginx controller that is managed by Harvester. You must also update other running ingress-nginx controllers. See the References section for more information.
